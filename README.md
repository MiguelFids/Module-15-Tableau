## Summary

Having a bikeshare program in the city is a very profitable business with a steady customer base. 

A graph to help with understanding the costs associated with the Rideshare program would be the total usage of the bicycle. The goal would be to display how many bikes they can expect to repair within the given year.

A graph to help with identifying key locations of heavy usage within Des Moins could provide better insight to how many bikes you may need to distribute to each station.
